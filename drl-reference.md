The **syntax** in Drools DRL like:

```drl
$c : Customer(age > 60)
```

Let’s break it down:

---

# 🔹 What `$c :` Means in Drools

* **Left side (`$c`)** → This is a **variable name (binding)** you assign.
* **Right side (`Customer(age > 60)`)** → This is the **pattern (fact type + condition)**.

So in plain English:

> “Find a `Customer` whose `age > 60` and bind it to the variable `$c`.”

---

# 🔹 Why Bind With `$c`?

Because you usually want to **use the matched fact later** (inside the `then` part or in other conditions).

Example:

```drl
rule "Senior Discount"
when
    $c : Customer(age > 60)   // bind the matched fact to $c
then
    $c.setDiscount(20);       // use it in action
    update($c);               // notify Drools fact changed
end
```

Without `$c`, you could match the fact, but you wouldn’t have a **reference** to manipulate it in the `then` part.

---

# 🔹 Multiple Facts Example

```drl
rule "Customer with Big Order"
when
    $c : Customer(age > 30)
    $o : Order(customer == $c, amount > 500)
then
    System.out.println($c.getName() + " placed a big order " + $o);
end
```

* `$c` binds to a `Customer`.
* `$o` binds to an `Order`.
* You can now **compare facts** (`Order.customer == $c`) because of the bindings.

---

✅ So the **trick** is:

* Use `ClassName(condition)` to *match facts*.
* Use `$variable :` in front if you want a **handle/reference** to that fact.

# skip `$c :`
Below is an explain when you can **skip `$c :`** (because sometimes you don’t actually need it)?


Perfect 👍 this is where a lot of people get confused when starting with Drools.

---

# 🔹 When You **Need** `$c :`

You use `$c :` (binding) when you want to:

1. **Reference the fact later** in the `then` part.

   ```drl
   $c : Customer(age > 60)
   ```

   → needed because we later do `$c.setDiscount(20);`

2. **Compare this fact with another fact**.

   ```drl
   $c : Customer()
   $o : Order(customer == $c)   // compare Order with the same customer
   ```

3. **Reuse attributes in calculations**.

   ```drl
   $c : Customer($age : age)
   ```

   → binds `$age` to the field, so you can use `$age` later.

---

# 🔹 When You Can **Skip** `$c :`

If you only care about the **condition**, but don’t need to *use the object later*, you don’t need a variable.

Example with `$c`:

```drl
rule "Senior Discount"
when
    $c : Customer(age > 60)
then
    $c.setDiscount(20);
    update($c);
end
```

Same rule **without binding** (won’t work if you need to change it!):

```drl
rule "Senior Discount"
when
    Customer(age > 60)   // no $c
then
    System.out.println("A senior customer exists!");
end
```

Here, we didn’t bind it, so we can only print something — we **can’t modify** the matched fact.

---

# 🔹 Practical Guideline

* ✅ If you **need to act on the object → bind it** with `$c :`.
* ✅ If you just **check a condition → skip it**.

---

👉 Think of it like SQL:

* `Customer(age > 60)` is like `SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE age > 60;`
* `$c : Customer(age > 60)` is like `SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE age > 60;` and store the row into a variable `$c` for later use.

---

A **side-by-side comparison** of Drools rules **with** and **without `$c :` binding**, so you can see exactly when it’s needed.

---

# 📝 Example Domain

```java
public class Customer {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int discount;
    // constructor, getters, setters
}
```

---

# 🔹 Case 1: **With Binding (`$c :`)**

```drl
rule "Senior Discount With Binding"
when
    $c : Customer(age > 60)   // bind fact to $c
then
    $c.setDiscount(20);       // we can change it
    update($c);               // tell Drools the fact changed
    System.out.println($c.getName() + " got a discount!");
end
```

✅ Here binding is **required**, because we want to:

* Update the fact (`setDiscount`)
* Access its data (`getName()`)

---

# 🔹 Case 2: **Without Binding**

```drl
rule "Senior Customer Exists"
when
    Customer(age > 60)   // no binding
then
    System.out.println("There is at least one senior customer!");
end
```

✅ Works fine when:

* You don’t need to change the object
* You just need to know **that it exists**

❌ But you **cannot do** `$c.setDiscount(20)` here — because there’s no `$c` reference!

---

# 🔹 Case 3: **Multiple Facts**

```drl
rule "Customer With Big Order"
when
    $c : Customer(age > 30)              // bind customer
    $o : Order(customer == $c, amount > 500)  // bind order and compare
then
    System.out.println($c.getName() + " placed a big order: " + $o);
end
```

✅ Binding is **essential** here, because we need to **compare facts** (`Order.customer == $c`).

---

# 🎯 Quick Rule of Thumb

* **Use `$c :`** when you:

  * Need to **reference** the fact in `then`
  * Want to **compare** it with another fact
  * Need to **update** it
* **Skip `$c :`** if you only care that *some fact exists*.
